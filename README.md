# Intro to Software Engineering Project

## Description
This project was meant to host a catalog of exercises with properties such as main muscle and PPL value (Push, Pull, or Legs). These exercises could be searched, filtered, and favorited (if logged in). It supports login/logout/signup functionality. Most of my portion centered about backend where I created the search bar and filtering in MySQL, login/logout/signup, and comment section. I designed the class and ERD diagrams, created and populated the database I hosted on AWS, created stored procedures and called them within php files, and helped with burndown charts and state diagrams. Some of the diagrams are documented in the project submission file.

## Visuals
Below is an image of our workout page with search bar functionality. The cards rotate when hovered over as well. This is just to show simple functionality and overall design template.

## Usage
The website was used for our final project and allowed a user to create an account, search and favorite exercises, and leave reviews as a comments section. There is not much usage now as database once hosted by AWS is down (I did not want to keep paying for it when the project has been turned in).
